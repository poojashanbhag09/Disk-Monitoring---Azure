# Disk-Monitoring---Azure

Scalable Disk Monitoring Solution for Cloud Environments
To proactively address disk space issues that can lead to downtime in multi-cloud environments, it is essential to implement a scalable and centralized monitoring strategy.
An effective solution should be simple to deploy, easy to manage, and capable of providing comprehensive visibility across cloud resources. Azure Monitor, a native Azure service, offers one such centralized monitoring approach.
This solution focuses on detecting low disk space early, enabling timely remediation and helping ensure business continuity by minimizing potential service disruptions for customers.

For keeping security and scalability in mind-

	• Azure Arc: Use Azure Arc to onboard and manage VMs across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. It allows centralized policy, security, and monitoring management.
	• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC in Azure to ensure only authorized users can access or manage specific resources.

	• Data Collection: Azure Monitor + DCR + InsightMetrics
		○ Enable performance counters via Data Collection Rules (DCR).
		○ Collect metrics like LogicalDisk(*)\% Free Space or LogicalDisk(*)\Free Megabytes.
		○ Data is stored in the InsightMetrics table in Log Analytics.
	• Azure Monitor Workbooks:
		○ Create custom dashboards using Log Analytics queries on InsightMetrics.
		○ Visualize trends, thresholds, and alerts.
	• Grafana Integration:
		○ Connect Grafana to Azure Monitor or Log Analytics for advanced visualization.

	• Tag-Based Targeting: Use Azure tags to group and manage VMs logically (e.g., by environment, project, or owner).
	• Scalable Monitoring:
		○ Use Data Collection Rules (DCRs) with scoped resource associations to automatically apply monitoring to new VMs.
		○ Azure Monitor scales automatically with the number of VMs and metrics.
	• Automation:
    ○ Use Azure Policy to enforce DCR and monitoring configurations on new resources.
