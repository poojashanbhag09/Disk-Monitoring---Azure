# **Scalable and Secure Disk Monitoring Solution in Azure and Hybrid Cloud Environments**

## **Overview**

In modern cloud and hybrid infrastructures, proactively monitoring disk space is critical to avoid service disruptions and ensure operational continuity. A scalable and centralized monitoring strategy helps detect and respond to low disk space conditions before they impact application availability or performance.

This solution leverages **Azure-native services**, along with optional integrations, to provide a **centralized, scalable, and secure monitoring framework** for disk utilization across Azure, on-premises, and other cloud platforms.

## **Key Design Considerations**

### **Security & Governance**

* **Azure Arc**: Extend Azure’s management and monitoring capabilities to on-premises and multi-cloud environments by onboarding virtual machines through Azure Arc. It provides unified visibility, policy enforcement, and compliance management across heterogeneous environments.

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to grant precise access rights based on roles. This ensures that only authorized users and services can interact with monitoring data or perform administrative actions, enhancing security posture.

---

### **Data Collection Architecture**

* **Azure Monitor + Log Analytics + Data Collection Rules (DCR)**:

  * Define DCRs to collect disk performance counters from target VMs.
  * Metrics such as:

    * `LogicalDisk(*)\% Free Space`
    * `LogicalDisk(*)\Free Megabytes`
  * These metrics are ingested and stored in the `InsightsMetrics` table within **Log Analytics Workspace** for centralized querying and correlation.
* **Tag-Based Resource Targeting**:

  * Leverage Azure Resource Tags (e.g., `Environment=Prod`, `App=SAP`) to logically group VMs.
  * Use these tags to dynamically scope DCRs and monitoring policies without manual intervention.


---

## **Visualization & Insights**

* **Azure Monitor Workbooks**:

  * Build interactive dashboards using Kusto Query Language (KQL) on data in `InsightsMetrics`.
  * A sample KQL query to analyze disk usage across virtual machines has been added to this repository.
  * Use it with Azure Log Analytics to monitor and visualize disk space metrics such as % Free Space and Free Megabytes.
  * Visualize:

    * Disk usage trends over time
    * Real-time free space
    * Threshold-based heatmaps and KPI tiles
  * Workbooks allow drill-downs for deeper root cause analysis.

* **Grafana Integration (Optional)**:

  * Connect **Azure Monitor** or **Log Analytics** as a data source in Grafana.
  * Use it to create advanced, customizable dashboards with additional flexibility in visualization and alerting.

---

## **Scalability & Automation**

* **Dynamic Scaling with DCRs**:

  * Associate DCRs with resource groups, subscriptions, or tag-based scopes.
  * New VMs are automatically monitored as they are created, with no need for manual onboarding.

* **Azure Policy for Compliance & Automation**:

  * Enforce DCR configurations and monitoring agents on all new virtual machines using **Azure Policy**.
  * Ensure consistent telemetry collection and adherence to monitoring standards across the environment.

* **Logic App Integration**:
  
  * Trigger: Alert rule invokes a Logic App via Action Group.
  * Logic App Workflow:
  * HTTP Trigger from Azure Monitor.
  * Parse JSON to extract VM name, disk info, and severity.
  * Call Azure Automation/Ansible Tower API (or Ansible AWX) to run a playbook.

## **Implementation Approaches**

| Approach                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach 1: Virtual Machine Insights** | Enable **VM Insights** to auto-collect performance data, including disk utilization, and visualize it through default performance charts and maps. Easily configurable from the Azure portal.           |
| **Approach 2: Pre-Built Workbooks**      | Utilize built-in Azure Monitor Workbooks such as **“Performance Analysis”** to track disk space and trigger alerts using minimal setup.                                                                 |
| **Approach 3: Custom KQL & Dashboards**  | Write tailored **Kusto queries** against `InsightsMetrics` to build personalized dashboards and alerts (e.g., notify when % free space is below a threshold). This allows full control and granularity. |
